# Tales From a New Dad
I'm Jay, a first time father. Our daughter joined us in January of 2016. I've been a stepfather to another young lady for a few years now, but the whole baby thing is new to me. On this blog, and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/talesfromanewdad), I'll document my experiences and thoughts. Sometimes they're amusing, but sometimes not.

I use [Facebook](https://facebook.com/talesfromanewdad) to post most of my quick thoughts and photos, but use this blog for my longer diatribes and stories.
