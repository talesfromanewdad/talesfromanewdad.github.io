Dear Caroline,

We're incredibly excited about what the future holds now that you've entered our life. Knowing all is well after we worried for so long about you is a wonderful feeling. I already know that you'll bring us joy for many years to come. With you now here, I want to share a few things with you about life, love, and the world you've been brought into.

##What I can learn from you##
Some may not think that a newborn has anything to teach an adult. _They couldn't be more wrong._

###Tabula Rasa###
_Tabula rasa_ means "clean slate" in latin. Just as I did, you'll make mistakes in life. Some are trivial and easily forgotten, while others linger for what may seem indefinitely. Witnessing the birth of a child - seeing the cleanest slate in existence - has made me realize that the slate, whether clean or besmirched, is truly in my control. I need only let go of my misgivings to restore my slate to its original standing.

###Hope###
You birth begets hope. Knowing that you have a lifetime ahead of you to fulfill your dreams gives inspires me to not give up on my own.

##What you can learn from me##

###Life###
Don't let someone tell you that life is easy. It's quite a trying experience. As much as we want to be in control, there are always variables and "unknown unknowns" that can quite easily put a stick in your spokes. Despite these difficulties, it's never prudent to give up. With great effort, comes great success. Rarely do things come easy, they must be earned. It's important to work hard, but be mindful that your career is only means to an end. Work to live, do not live to work.

Knowledge is an incredibly important part of life. Your education continues beyond formal schooling. Don't limit yourself to trite or clich√©d topics, or even subjects taught in school. Get out of your comfort zone. Learn something new every day.

###Love###
Love is not objective. It's nearly impossible to explain and each person you ask will describe it differently. Here are a few tips I can offer you:

* Always respect yourself. Don't allow others to influence how you feel about yourself.

* Relationships are partnerships. There's no majority stakeholder. Both are equal.

* Love knows no race, religion, or gender. We do not pick who we love. Follow your heart, but don't completely ignore your brain.

* Be honest with yourself and with your partner. Don't attempt to be someone you aren't in order to appeal to another.

###Our World###
The world you were born into is both extraordinary **and** atrocious. Our society has made great strides over the last century, but intolerance and a culture of ignorance threatens to destroy all that we have all worked so hard to build. Despite being the age of information, where ignorance should be nonexistent, people seem to go out of their way to ignore logic and fact. Some even take pride in their ignorance. We must not succumb to this way of thinking (_or **not** thinking, depending on how you look at it_). Education is the key to maintaining our society. With education, comes understanding, and with understanding comes tolerance and patience, and with tolerance and patience, comes peace and prosperity.

##The Future##
I look forward to...

* Changing your diaper whilst wearing a poncho.

* <del>Secretly tasting breast milk.</del>

* Being woken up at 1:00 AM, 2:37 AM, 3:19 AM, 5:06 AM, and also 6:12 AM. Every. Night.

* Your first steps.

* Your first words.

* Not listening to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwlAdEnT-do) again.

* Your first day of school.

* Graduation. (_These days you graduate from pretty much every grade. It's a lot like getting a participation trophy._)

* Interrogating your boyfriend. (_Perhaps waterboarding will be legal by then._)

* Graduation.

* Paying your car insurance premiums. (_For a very, very short period..._)

* Graduation. (_Do you see a pattern here?_)

* Unpacking your things in your dorm room.

* Graduation.

* Walking you down the aisle. (_If that's your thing; marriage._)

* The birth(s) our grandchild(ren). (_Or adoption. Or no kids. Again, totally up to you. Kind of._)


...and whatever else our life together may bring.

With Unconditional Love,

Your Father
