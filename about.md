I'm Jay, a soon to be first time father. Our daughter is expected to join us in January of 2016. I've been a stepfather to another young lady for a few years now, but the whole baby thing is new to me.

I use [Facebook](https://facebook.com/talesfromanewdad) to post most of my quick thoughts and photos, but use this blog for my longer diatribes and stories.
